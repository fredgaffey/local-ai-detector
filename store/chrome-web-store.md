# Chrome Web Store listing text

For the Developer Dashboard's listing fields. Permission justifications and
the data-collection declaration are in [`permissions.md`](permissions.md)
(copy those into the dashboard's separate "Permissions justification" and
"Data usage" forms). Promo images: [`promo/`](promo/). Screenshots (1280×800,
upload in this order): [`screenshots/`](screenshots/) (card + highlights,
sentence details, popup, YouTube). Older shots in
[`../docs/qa/shots/`](../docs/qa/shots/) and [`../docs/screenshots/`](../docs/screenshots/) show earlier UI.

## Category

**Productivity** (or **Tools**, if Chrome's current category list splits
them differently by the time you submit — pick whichever is closest; this
isn't a niche pick specific to one category taxonomy version). Not
"Accessibility": it doesn't change how a page is rendered or read, only adds
an analysis overlay.

## Long description

```
Local AI Detector analyzes the text and images on the page you're reading for
signs of AI generation — entirely on your device. No servers, no API keys, no
accounts, no data collection of any kind.

WHAT IT DOES

• Scores visible text with on-device detectors. By default that's Fusion:
  Mozilla's Fakespot RoBERTa plus TMR, combined, showing how many agree. You
  can mix in ModernBERT, a lite model, perplexity or experimental Binoculars.
  It highlights flagged sentences on the page (heatmap, flagged-only, or
  underline) and shows a calibrated probability ("AI 91%"), not a made-up score.
• Flags hidden/invisible Unicode characters in text (shown separately, never
  counted as "AI evidence" — ordinary typography and copy-pasting from Word
  or PDFs produce these too).
• Checks images for C2PA Content Credentials (cryptographically verified
  against a bundled trust list), unsigned generator metadata (Stable
  Diffusion, Midjourney, NovelAI, and others), and open-source invisible
  watermarks (Stable Diffusion/SDXL/FLUX). Clearly labels what CAN'T be
  checked locally too (e.g. Google SynthID, Anthropic's and Gemini's text
  watermarks) rather than staying silent about it.
• Knows the page it's on: a single score for an article, a score per comment
  or reply on Reddit/Hacker News/forums/reviews/chat sites, and small markers
  on flagged search-result snippets. An optional slop filter dims flagged
  comments and reviews; an optional local-only site memory tracks a
  per-domain tally.
• On YouTube, reads the video's transcript and, experimentally, samples the
  audio itself to flag likely AI narration — nothing about the video or
  audio ever leaves the device.
• On about 115 popular sites (Reddit, Hacker News, YouTube, Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, X, Amazon reviews, Wikipedia, major news and more) it checks automatically; on any other site, click the toolbar button or right-click.
• A fast automatic check runs by default; a one-click "Deep check" reads the
  whole page with the best-measured detector pair.

WHY IT'S DIFFERENT

• 100% local. All analysis — text scoring, image checks — runs in your
  browser. The only network requests this extension ever makes are
  downloading AI models (once, after you consent, ~35–400 MB depending on
  the detectors you pick) from Hugging Face and, for the voice model, this
  project's GitHub release, and, only for a site you've explicitly allowed,
  fetching one image's bytes to check it. Full accounting in our privacy
  policy.
• Honest about accuracy. This is not a forensic tool and doesn't pretend to
  be one. On held-out web text the default detectors flag about two-thirds of
  AI-written texts and about 5% of human ones; the slop filter is stricter (99%
  of what it hides is AI, and it catches about half). Paraphrased or edited
  text mostly passes, and a low score means "no strong AI signal", not "human".
  We publish the actual numbers and their limitations rather than a vague
  "99% accurate" claim.
• Fully open source (MIT licence). Every model and library it bundles is
  openly licensed (MIT/Apache-2.0/MPL-2.0); nothing gated, nothing
  non-commercial. Read the code, the calibration methodology, and the
  research behind every provenance signal it checks.

WHAT IT DOESN'T DO

It doesn't claim certainty. "No watermark found" is shown as exactly that —
not as proof of human authorship. It doesn't send your browsing or any page
content anywhere. It doesn't require an account, a subscription, or an API
key. It doesn't work by calling a cloud AI-detection API — everything runs
on your own machine.

Source code, full technical documentation (architecture, calibration
methodology, provenance research), and the privacy policy are linked from
the extension's own Options page and from its source repository.

## Notes for whoever fills in the dashboard

- Chrome's "Data usage" form: see
  [`permissions.md`](permissions.md#data-usage-disclosures-chrome-web-store-data-collection-form) —
  declare no data collection.
- Homepage / support URL: point at the source repository (or an issues page
  there) — there's no separate support site.
- Privacy policy URL: publish [`../PRIVACY.md`](../PRIVACY.md) somewhere with
  a stable URL (e.g. the repository's rendered file on GitHub) and paste that
  URL into the listing's privacy policy field.
