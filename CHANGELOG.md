# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-07

- Chrome: **Run on every site** (Options, or "Auto-check on every site" in the popup on a site outside the built-in list). One browser permission prompt; the automatic check and image checks then work on every site. Revoke it any time from Chrome's extension settings. Nothing about what's read or sent changes: everything stays on your device.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-30

- Chrome: the automatic check runs on a curated list of ~115 sites (forums, social, blogs, reviews, reference, news). On any other site, click the toolbar button, use the right-click menu or a shortcut. Firefox still runs everywhere.

- Quick check reads at most ~1,024 tokens (setting: Tiers → Quick check length); the Deep check (↻) still reads the whole page. Keeps long pages fast, notably on Firefox.

**First public release.** There is no public 0.1.0 — that version number was
an internal development milestone only, never packaged or submitted to a
store (see [`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md) "Phases and release"). Everything
below is what ships in this first release.

### Added

- **Page-type routing**: an article, a thread, a video, a subtitle file, a
  search page and an app each get the check that suits them (page text,
  per-item scoring, transcript + voice, timed subtitle scoring, snippet
  markers, or nothing automatic). Per-site override in Options.
- **Two tiers**: an automatic **Quick** check (TMR over the first ~1,024
  tokens; a page that reads ≥ 50% is re-checked with Fusion before anything
  is shown) and an on-demand **Deep** check (Fakespot + TMR over the whole
  page, the best-measured set; docs/calibration.md "Deep check"). A manual
  check shows Quick at once and refines to Deep; Deep can be cancelled.
- **Corner card** (default presence): on every page, draggable (position
  remembered per site), hover for the essentials, click for the panel with
  Deep check, flagged-item navigation, highlights and "highlight by model".
  Highlights default to AI sentences only; click a highlighted sentence for
  its details. Wording reads "N% AI · no strong / some AI signal / likely AI".
- **Remembered results**: an unchanged page reuses its last result (local,
  text hash only). **Pause** automatic checks for 1/5/12 h from the popup.
- **YouTube transcripts, description and voice check (experimental, on by
  default)**: reads the transcript through the player's own caption request,
  scores the video description, and samples short audio clips for likely
  synthetic narration from the audio the player downloads, so it works at
  any playback speed (other sites: 0.75–2×). Menus under the title for a
  Deep check, the transcript's AI parts, and the sampled clips.
  Detects AI-written scripts and clean/compressed TTS — not every synthetic
  voice, and not a substitute for a watermark check.
- **Presence**: one setting (default **Status chip**) for how much the
  extension shows — On click, Badge, Status chip, Inspector, or Side panel
  — with per-site auto-run rules and a "never on this site" toggle.
- **More entry points**: context menus (page, image, text box), a popup
  paste box and file drop (.txt/.md/.html/.docx), and rebindable keyboard
  shortcuts.
- **Chat/thread/comment adapters**: assistant-only scoring on ChatGPT,
  Claude, Gemini, Copilot and Perplexity-style UIs; per-comment/per-post
  scoring on Reddit, Hacker News, forums, reviews and YouTube comments.
- **Slop filter** (off by default): dims/collapses flagged comments, posts
  and reviews, plus a small marker on flagged search-result snippets
  (snippet text only, never the linked page).
- **Site memory** (off by default, local only): a per-domain tally,
  clearable from Options.
- **Battery saver**: Battery Status API / Compute Pressure gating where
  available, a manual toggle where they're not, and an idle-unload timer.
- **Fusion detector mode**: any mix of Fakespot, TMR, ModernBERT, the lite
  model, perplexity and experimental Binoculars, combined by weighted
  average (default), log-odds, vote or max, with an agreement count.
- **Model updates**: "Check for updates" against the Hugging Face API,
  one-click update with rollback, and custom-model support with a licence
  warning.
- **Provenance and watermarks for images**: C2PA / Content Credentials,
  unsigned generator metadata, a from-scratch SD/SDXL/FLUX invisible
  watermark decoder, and C2PA text manifests — with an explicit "cannot be
  checked locally" list (SynthID, Claude's and Gemini's text watermarks,
  Meta Content Seal, Digimarc, TrustMark) rather than staying silent.
- A hidden-Unicode scan, always shown separately from the AI score.

### Performance and battery

- Inference runs in Workers, never on the popup's thread (the popup opens
  instantly during a check).
- Idle unload frees the models' memory after 5 minutes without model use.
- Background tabs wait for their first showing before the automatic check;
  per-tab timers pause when hidden; the voice audio graph only runs while a
  clip is recorded.

### Fixed (release QA in real Chrome, [`docs/qa-results.md`](docs/qa-results.md))

44 rows tested end to end; 36 passed outright and 8 passed with a documented
caveat (login walls, a native-menu testing limitation, one detector
limitation on casual ChatGPT replies). 23 rows failed on first try and were
fixed, including: the automatic Quick check putting ≥ 50% on plainly human
pages (see "Fixed (false positives)" below); several sites' comments/answers/
reviews/snippets not being scored per item; page types for JS-heavy essay and
shop pages; shared-chat pages scoring every turn as the assistant; the slop
filter, site memory and battery-saver switches not doing anything until
acted on; badge/side-panel/tooltip percentages showing the raw score instead
of the calibrated one; and keyboard shortcuts that took over browser/OS keys
(now Alt+Shift+A/S/V, Control+Shift on macOS).

### Fixed (false positives on human pages, [`docs/calibration.md`](docs/calibration.md#quick-tier-and-false-positives-qa-pass-2026-09-28))

The automatic Quick check now uses TMR instead of the lite model, with any
result ≥ 50% re-checked against Fusion before it's shown, and the chip
raised to show only from 70% (was 35%). On the web eval set this cuts human
texts shown ≥ 50% from 41% to 3%, while AI texts shown ≥ 70% rise from 51%
to 67%. Examples: an r/AskHistorians thread 95% → 41%, Wikipedia 82% → 34%,
a TED talk transcript 53% → 23%.

### Known limitations

- Tuned to favour a low false-positive rate over catching everything:
  paraphrased, edited, or "write like a human"-prompted AI text mostly
  passes, as it does for every public detector.
- Forum-style posts are the hardest genre; non-native English writing scores
  higher on detectors like this (a known bias); text under ~30 words shows
  "—" rather than a number.
- Binoculars, ModernBERT (as a standalone mode) and the voice check are
  experimental / newer and the least-tested paths.
- Calibration is one ~1,900-text web eval set (English only); see
  [`docs/calibration.md`](docs/calibration.md) for full numbers and caveats,
  including the ChatGPT-share limitation (casual 2026 ChatGPT replies read
  low even under Deep — a detector limitation, not a pipeline bug).
- Firefox wasn't covered by the release QA pass (Chrome only); see
  [`docs/qa-results.md`](docs/qa-results.md).
