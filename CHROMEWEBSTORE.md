# Chrome Web Store: submission record

Everything the Chrome Web Store dashboard asks for, kept current as the code changes.
**Keep this file in sync whenever a permission, host, content-script match, data flow or
listing claim changes** (the built `.output/chrome-mv3/manifest.json` is the source of truth).

## Current manifest (Chrome build, v0.2.0)

- **permissions:** `storage`, `activeTab`, `scripting`, `contextMenus`, `alarms`, `offscreen`, `sidePanel`
- **host_permissions (fetch only):** `https://huggingface.co/*`, `https://*.hf.co/*` (text models);
  `https://github.com/*`, `https://release-assets.githubusercontent.com/*` (voice model from the
  `models-v1` release, sha256-verified)
- **optional_host_permissions:** `<all_urls>`, granted per site on click, for image provenance checks; if granted for all sites, also used to add the content script to already-open tabs after an update
- **content_scripts:** a curated list of ~115 sites (`src/shared/autoSites.ts`: forums, social,
  blogging platforms, reviews, reference, news), each host plus subdomains, for the automatic local
  Quick check and card. Any other site works on demand: the toolbar button, right-click menu and
  shortcuts grant `activeTab` and the script is injected into that tab. The Firefox build keeps
  `<all_urls>`. Install warning: "Read and change your data on a number of websites".
- **content_scripts (page world):** `*://www.youtube.com/*`, `*://m.youtube.com/*`, `world: MAIN`,
  `document_start`. Reads the current video's captions through YouTube's own player so the
  transcript check works (YouTube no longer serves caption files to plain requests). Talks only
  to youtube.com, uses no extension APIs, and restores the viewer's caption settings afterwards.
  No new permission or install warning (youtube.com is on the curated list).
- **commands:** analyze-page, analyze-selection, toggle-visibility (defaults Alt+Shift+A/S/V; Control+Shift+A/S/V on macOS)
- **CSP:** `script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'` (WASM bundled, no remote code)

## Review risks to expect

- **Site access** (content script on the curated list): the first Chrome release avoids
  `<all_urls>` so it isn't held for the in-depth review broad host access triggers.

## Host access

v0.2.0 (Chrome) auto-runs only on the curated list. The next version restores all-sites
auto-run. Adding `<all_urls>` to the required content-script matches in an update would make
Chrome disable the extension for existing users until they accept the new warning, so plan it
as an opt-in instead: an "Auto-check on all sites" switch that requests the already-declared
optional `<all_urls>` permission and registers the content script with
`scripting.registerContentScripts`. That needs no manifest permission change.
- **Large runtime downloads** (models from Hugging Face and GitHub): these are data, not code.
  All executable code (JS and WASM) ships in the package.

## Pre-submission checklist

- [ ] Version bumped (package.json and CHANGELOG)
- [ ] `npm run package` green (CI does this on every push)
- [ ] This file matches the built manifest (permissions, hosts, matches)
- [ ] PRIVACY.md lists every network destination
- [ ] Screenshots current
